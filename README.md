# Claude Challenges

A collection of ML engineering challenges generated by AI

## Format
An educational experiment in which I attempt to learn ML by prompting Claude 3.5 Sonnet for programming or research challenges. 

Tradition course formats aren't motivating and typically don't overlap optimally with learning goals. The hope is that diving straight into interesting problems (and only then using learning resources as aid) will speed up the learning process. 

### Approach

Tackle complex, open-ended problems
Use various ML/DL libraries and technologies
Embrace chaos in the learning process

### Challenges

1. Variational Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection
[More to come...]
